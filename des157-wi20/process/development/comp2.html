        <p>On the original design comp, I was still getting used to using figma and made a pretty basic draft of my final project. In this sketch I want to add more moving elements to my page. I have the map in the background, which I am still not sure if I will animate or just have hover in the background as the viewer scrolls. As the viewer scrolls, more blocks of text pop out from the sides and maybe some pop out of spots on the map, but that part might be difficult. I wanted the navigation to pop out of the side and cover the page. Since it covers the whole screen I don't think I have to make new pages for the About, Resources, or Contact page. This might be difficult to code, especially for mobile so I might change this part later as well.</p>
