         Final Project Academic Research</p>
         The project I want to create is a web page that shows opportunities to volunteer but also the reasons why people volunteer and the benefits of volunteering. I hope to encourage people to pursue volunteer work. I believe people might start after hearing about how volunteering can help them, but I hope they continue doing it because they realize they enjoy the work.
             I watched a Ted Talk video on Youtube. The speaker talked about her first experiences volunteering and how people have concerns and confusions as to why someone would want to volunteer. While some people could look at these events for personal gain, the speaker said that the most simple and common reason people volunteer is because they enjoy it. An example she gives is the festival in her country that mirrors Burning Man. The entire festival is volunteer based so nothing is paid for. All members of the staff are there because they enjoy it and want to help. This concept seems strange at first but I think if a person finds a volunteering event that interests them will be passionate about it and want to help and get to know it better.
             Other articles like Forbes, The Balance Small Business, and Helpguide.org highlight that benefits to the person volunteering. It can improve a  person’s health but also their mental health as well. According to Forbes, it also helps improve or learn skills. These experiences can even be used to help land a job,since these experiences or skills can translate to real life skills needed for certain jobs.
         The Balance Small Business has a more specific and detailed list. This list details certain diseases that scare a lot of people. They say these diseases have a lowered chance of affecting a person if they volunteer.
         I think for the most part I want to make a page to persuade someone to try volunteering. I think having up to date events would be nice, however there are already sites for that purpose. I think the user should explore a place on the website and fit little interactive parts of the screen. I hope that these hover-over type of messages will reach the user and make them think more carefully.
