         <p>Gucci Grip was a game I found online. It uses swiping motions to jump and dodge obstacles. Because of the swiping motions, I think this would be better on a tablet or phone than on a computer. It just dumps you into the game right away, it has no explanation or a story behind it. I don't think it has a great message behind it or any infromation to share but it is a nice fun game. I really like that it is super colorful and entertaining to play. I think it can be improved with a story or some information it tells you in the end or in the begginning or something. It would be good if it had a share button so you can share your score online and get others to play, so you can spread the word of the site and have others see it.</p>

         <p>Let Girls Dream is a website to showcase people's dreams. It doesn't just showcase girl's dreams. Most are goals in life, what people want to accomplish or how they want the world to be. I think it is a great way to voice an idea or a goal and have others hear it. However I noticed a few people not taking it seriously and that damages the image a bit. I think a moderator for the submission would be useful to maintain an image. Each dream is a star that lights up when you mouse over it. And to find all the stars you have to explore the page. The interactivity is good and it is a good idea for displaying information.</p>
