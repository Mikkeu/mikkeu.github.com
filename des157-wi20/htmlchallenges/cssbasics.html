                Inheritance in CSS
            </h2>
            <p>
                Inheritance in CSS is the values from the parent element being applied to the current element. For example, in the body tag, if it is a blue color background and the p tag has no background color assigned to it, then the p tag will also have the backgroung color be blue.

            <h2>
                Specificity in CSS
            </h2>
            <p>
                Specificity in CSS helps decide which part of the code gets effected by the css. More specific selector has more importance to a less specific one so it will have priority. A class selector is more important than an element selector. This allows us to change very specific tags instead of changing every single one of those tags. A compound selector can select something very specific like a class within a tag. A multiple selector is something that adds the same CSS to two different classes.

            <h2>
                ID and Class Attributes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Class selector has a period in front of it (.). While a ID has a hashtag in front of it (#). The difference between them is that class can identify more than one element while ID can be used to identify one element.
